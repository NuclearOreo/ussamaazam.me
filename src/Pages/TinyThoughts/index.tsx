        Just some of my tiny thoughts, take them as shower thoughts, not worth taking too seriously
        but something to play with.

              Smart people with strongly held ideas probably cause more problems than good. The
              opposite of humble. The more strongly it's held the less kind you are to others and
              yourself.

              Solitude is a gift to me. Clear thinking, reading, studying, exploring and
              appreciating. It's hard not to see yourself grow with space to yourself.

              The only real accomplishment in life is to have good health for majority of it. Don't
              let sugar or processed foods ruin your life, no amount of money can fix that.

              I think if you really embrace reality for a moment, then narratives and identities
              dies with it. You're actually present. Those constructs are meant to persuade people
              but yourself, you need to live.

              Personal Responsibility only works if you get royally humbled. Before that, you're
              clueless so I can't fault you.
