        but something to play with.

              Two things I have to keep relearning: it's never that serious, and stay in the present
              to be your best self.

              Rigorous learning is one the ways to combat social media. Try to learn something that
              requires you putting in work.

              Affirmation of ideas leaves no room for creativity, being a memetic issue. Focused on
              being right but missing the bigger picture.

              You need good stories to have a good spirit and you need to solve problems to have a
              good life.

              Solving problems and creating scalable solutions is probably the best way to avoid war
              and infighting. After that is avoiding zero sum mentality.

              Smart people with strongly held ideas probably cause more problems than good. The
              opposite of humble. The more strongly it's held the less kind you are to others and
              yourself.

              Solitude is a gift to me. Clear thinking, reading, studying, exploring and
              appreciating. It's hard not to see yourself grow with space to yourself.

              The only real accomplishment in life is to have good health for majority of it. Don't
              let sugar or processed foods ruin your life, no amount of money can fix that.

              I think if you really embrace reality for a moment, then narratives and identities
              dies with it. You're actually present. Those constructs are meant to persuade people
              but yourself, you need to live.

              Personal Responsibility only works if you get royally humbled. Before that, you're
              clueless so I can't fault you.
