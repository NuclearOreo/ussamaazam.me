        <h2>My Relationship with Smoking ðŸš­</h2>
        <div>
          My first exposure to smoking happened early on in my life, way too young to be appropriate
          (granted, smoking is never right at any age). It kind of happened around early high
          school, the time when I started doing pretty stupid stuff. My friends and I smoked weed
          during those days, and sometimes we ended up getting our hands on some cigarettes. It was
          normal back then for skaters to smoke weed and cigarettes, and frankly normal now, but
          that's how I got introduced to smoking. And it's funny, it was never really a problem,
          yeah it was terrible for my health, but I never got hooked on them. It was purely social;
          never smoking cigarettes out of the company that didn't have it themselves. It was a
          regular thing for me but a small part of my life.
        </div>
        <div>
          Fast forward a bit, I started taking my academics seriously and attending a
          dual-enrollment high school. That took me away from the skaters and "bad" (doubling
          quoting here because they're perceived as bad people) influences that I was around. Now
          surrounded by high schoolers who were avid learners and try-hards who cared greatly about
          their future, smoking became a distant memory. Since I was a social smoker then, I never
          had anything pushing me toward it. At some point, I felt somewhat ashamed that I did smoke
          when I looked back during those later high school years.
        </div>
        <div>
          Funnily enough, the D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program that existed back
          then that I think most kids go through during their education at some point never really
          affected kids significantly back then. Maybe it was Miami, and Miami is kind of a crazy
          city to raise a kid in. But it was somewhat of a point of pride doing something like
          smoking cigarettes but not being addicted. Maybe it was because of how dramatic the
          D.A.R.E program would make these drugs sound to us, but when experiencing the reality of
          it, it felt far from what they portrayed it as (at least to me). I'm sharing this because
          we felt general apathy about it, never taking it seriously; at the very least, I didn't
          take it seriously. Even though I did feel a sense of guilt about smoking later on, I still
          didn't take it seriously as if it were a mortal threat to my life. For me, it felt like a
          joke that someone could get addicted to cigarettes. Little did I know, I was about to get
          humbled for feeling that way.
        </div>
        <div>
          Later on, moving on to university, around my second year, I started picking up the pace
          for going out. During my first year of college, I kind of had my head in the books and
          made some space for activities such as rock climbing (the only form of exercise I had) and
          some clubs. But things started to feel boring to me; I thought I needed to socialize more
          outside the university activities. Eventually, I stumbled upon a girl through a mutual
          friend, and she started to take me to the pub near the university. We hit it off pretty
          quickly, but because I'm an idiot, it led me down a dark path.
        </div>
        <div>
          Being the silly person that I was, I fell for her. Head over heels like a fool.
          Coincidentally we came roughly from the same neighborhood (North Miami Area), and she
          reminded me of my hometown. Living in Orlando for university, she felt like a breath of
          air to someone feeling a little homesick; needless to say, I tried to spend as much time
          with her, and our mutual activity over the weekend was going to the pub. We usually went
          to the pub with our group of friends to have a good time. I was never much of a drinker
          and didn't enjoy it all that much. Generally, people were smoking on the patio, and when I
          had enough of being at the bar, I would join them. I picked up smoking again to kill time
          during those outings, which felt natural in that environment.
        </div>
        <div>
          After some time, smoking started to become my pub identity. Something I would default to,
          bringing a pack of my own. Earlier in my pub adventures, I would "cop a stog" from people,
          but now I was purchasing a pack of my own which was a big step. Never at any point in my
          life before then did I buy cigarettes, I was always getting them from someone else. I
          started doing it because I knew I was going to the pub on the weekend with my friends and
          didn't care to drink. Everything I started doing was setting me up for disaster. From the
          people I was hanging out with to the habits I picked up.
        </div>
        <div>
          Eventually, at some point, I had a falling out with the girl that brought me into our
          weekend adventures. Because I was as immature as I was at that time, I went into a
          depressive spiral. I was head over heels for her, and being the semblance of home I had, I
          lost myself. My identity dissipated, and I needed a way to cope. Unfortunately, because I
          started buying cigarettes, some were lying around in my bedroom, and I defaulted to them
          when I had to deal with my darkest moments. It became a ritual to deal with any negative
          feelings I had. A well of bad memories or anxiety comes my way; I would buy a pack or pick
          a cigarette and start smoking away. It kept getting worse; I didn't have anyone to talk to
          about how I felt and no support system since I was away from family for university, and
          they were dealing with their own problems, so unable to help out meaningfully. As time
          went on, I became more aggressive with smoking; I didn't want to deal with my emotions and
          took any chance to push them down. At some point, my â€œfall from grace" landed me smoking
          almost a pack a day, something I never thought would happen to me, and it happened
          relatively quickly; in about a year, I became a chain smoker.
        </div>
        <div>
          I knew I was in a bad place, but I kept going until one night, I felt my chest burning
          after I coughed, and the discomfort kept me up. Throughout, I started to understand the
          damage I was doing to myself. I knew if I kept going in this direction, I would have
          ruined my health and, probably at worst, become a burden to my family for falling so hard.
          At some point, I started focusing on how much of a burden I'd be to my family if I kept
          hurting myself, which motivated me to do better. So I slowly started limiting myself from
          cigarettes and moved to do some cardio at the gym. I still needed cigarettes because I was
          still dealing with emotional issues, and those emotions kept pushing me back, but I
          thought at least some cardio could help me combat some of the damage. These cardio
          sessions really showed me where I was health-wise; I felt a bit of discomfort in my chest
          every time I ran and pushed my lungs. That discomfort became a focal point for me,
          something to fight against.
        </div>
        <div>
          Somewhere along the line, I discovered David Goggins, a crazy man on the internet with a
          mentality of steel. I was utterly enamored by this man, embodying the mentality that I
          felt needed to push me through this battle I was going through. His "Stay Hard" mentality
          got me to create challenges for myself, to force myself to be 5 to 10 seconds faster every
          week for my mile run. A simple challenge I thought I was perfect for fighting against the
          discomfort I had in my chest and strengthening my lungs and heart. At that time, I did
          have a few cigarettes a week because there was still some anxiety and unresolved emotional
          issues that were still lingering. It wasn't addiction but coping that kept me attached to
          cigarettes; there was something comforting I found in them, allowing me to really feel
          these negative emotions without going off the rails.
        </div>
        <div>
          Shortly after, I graduated with my undergraduate degree and moved back to my parents'
          place to situate myself and start searching for a job. I was still working out and
          running, keeping up with the challenge I held myself to, getting myself close to
          six-minute mile runs. At this point, I went from a few cigarettes a week to a few
          cigarettes a month. The only thing that kept bringing me back at this point was that I
          would fall into an overwhelming negative spell, bringing me to smoke a few cigarettes to
          cope. The habitual aspect of smoking and small withdrawal wasn't much of an issue because
          I used working out to take over my attention, but depressive emotional waves were
          something else.
        </div>
        <div>
          These depressive waves were basically my last hurdle, stemming from my unresolved
          emotional issues, and I needed a way to address this. Ideally, if I weren't around any
          smokers, I would sit with my emotions since there's a lot of friction in simply getting
          into your car and driving to the store to grab a pack. Unluckily my dad smoked, and since
          I was back home, any moment of weakness would quickly push me toward those cigarettes.
          Also, after some failed attempts with my dad to make him stop smoking, I realized it was
          easier to address my issues rather than forcing someone to comply and making their life
          hard. So after some thought and searching through the internet, I decided to start keeping
          a streak and journal how I felt.
        </div>
        <div>
          I thought that creating visibility of the last time I had a cigarette would incentivize me
          to keep the streak as long as possible and, when I failed, explain how I felt and the
          cause of the emotions. In the beginning, I could hold my streak for a few days, only
          breaking it because some memories would flood my head. Some of those memories would jump
          out at me when I visited places from my upbringing, reminding me of certain friends. Other
          times would be visiting my uncle at the hospital while in critical care. It boiled down to
          reminders of the past or negative present conditions that would bring this tide of
          emotions I couldn't handle. Creating a visible guide of the last time I had cigarettes was
          a good motivator, but it didn't matter if these negative emotions still kept me in a
          chokehold.
        </div>
        <div>
          Eventually, out of frustration, I stumbled into the habit of walking for an hour or more
          to keep myself at ease. Whenever I fell into a negative spell or just got tired of my
          life, I would walk around and sometimes have a cigarette, but since I was trying to kick
          the habit, I just decided to focus on walking until my legs hurt. This turned out way
          better than I thought; these long walks were the perfect way for me to decompress.
          Something about movement has my mind wandering to places; this wandering would guide me
          away from the negative emotions and lead me to a perspective that would help me handle my
          emotions better. It became therapy for me, and I still do it to this day, walking for
          about an hour or more until my legs ache.
        </div>
        <div>
          Slowly I started to see my streak get longer and longer, going a few weeks to a few months
          and eventually hitting a year and a few months being my longest. Sadly, I broke it because
          I was curious if it had the same hold on me as it used to; also, the fact I do enjoy the
          taste of tobacco was another incentive for me. To my surprise, I had mixed feelings about
          it; I did enjoy the taste, but a sense of disgust came with it too. Something about that
          year-long pause got my body to feel differently toward those cigarettes. That was at least
          relieving to me because it told me that smoking didn't have the same hold on me, something
          I used to jump to as a coping mechanism.
        </div>
        <div>
          On the same day, I broke my streak, I restarted my streak, and I'm currently at day 82
          since I had my last cigarette. I won't lie by saying that it's been sunshine and rainbows
          from my longest streak. I've restarted several times, having a few month streaks each
          attempt. It seems my new challenge is apathy since smoking doesn't feel like a real threat
          to me anymore, just like in the early days, and I wouldn't mind breaking the streak. This
          apathy is where I'm in the most dangerous position of falling back. Smoking no longer
          feeling like a threat is a problem because I felt like I had conquered it but looking at
          my recent streaks, it doesn't reflect that. At the very least, whenever challenging
          emotions arise, smoking is not the first thing I think of turning to. It's no longer
          habitual, so there is no good reason for me to continue breaking my streaks. Only my lack
          of care and discipline was at fault. So I decided to make it a lifelong habit to journal
          my streak. To turn it into a multi-year, multi-decade journey. I'm confident I could do
          that since my longest streak was a year and three months; I just have to make it into a
          daily ritual and remind myself to be constantly vigilant, a rule I have to live by for the
          rest of my life.
        </div>
        <div>
          I know people have different experiences with smoking and cigarettes, and many people fall
          into worse situations than me. Getting cancer, losing limbs, losing family, and a whole
          array of sad irredeemable issues, but I want to share my relationship with it, not as a
          victory story or a cautionary tale but (I think) a normal human experience. Someone that
          never took it seriously, only to get humbled later on but eventually returned to the same
          apathy that poses a real threat of falling back. I wanted to write and share this to
          remind myself of what I went through and reassure people on the same journey not to feel
          bad if they arrive at the same apathy. Maybe it's a human thing not to care when we think
          we have conquered the issue, but let's not drop our guard. Let's make it a problem to keep
          at it.
